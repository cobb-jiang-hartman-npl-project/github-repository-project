# GitHub Natural Language Processing Project

## Purpose
This repository holds all resources used in the attainment of the goals established for the GitHub Natural Language Processing Project.

## Goals
Build a model that can predict the programming language of a repository given the text data of the accompanying README file.

## Data
Repository data scraped from GitHub.

## Deliverables

### Need to Haves:
1. Model
2. A well-documented jupyter notebook that contains our analysis
3. Presentation summarizing our findings


### Nice to Haves:
1. GUI for model

## Cloing
All files necessary for cloning and reproducing the work found in the final_project.ipynb file are contained within this repository.

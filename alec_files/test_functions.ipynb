    "This second programming assignment will require you to write an R function that is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations. For example, taking the mean of a numeric vector is typically a fast operation. However, for a very long vector, it may take too long to compute the mean, especially if it has to be computed repeatedly (e.g. in a loop). If the contents of a vector are not changing, it may make sense to cache the value of the mean so that when we need it again, it can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed. In this Programming Assignment you will take advantage of the scoping rules of the R language and how they can be manipulated to preserve state inside of an R object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Caching the Mean of a Vector\n",
    "In this example we introduce the <<- operator which can be used to assign a value to an object in an environment that is different from the current environment. Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a numeric vector and caches its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first function, makeVector creates a special \"vector\", which is really a list containing a function to\n",
    "\n",
    "set the value of the vector\n",
    "get the value of the vector\n",
    "set the value of the mean\n",
    "get the value of the mean\n",
    "makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {\n",
    "        m <- NULL\n",
    "        set <- function(y) {\n",
    "                x <<- y\n",
    "                m <<- NULL\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        get <- function() x\n",

    "        getmean <- function() m\n",

    "             setmean = setmean,\n",
    "             getmean = getmean)\n",
    "}\n",
    "The following function calculates the mean of the special \"vector\" created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.\n",

    "Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix\n",
    "Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special \"matrix\" object that can cache its inverse.\n",
    "cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special \"matrix\" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.\n",
    "Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.\n",

    "In order to complete this assignment, you must do the following:\n",

    "What is Bitcoin?\n",
    "Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, as well as an immediately usable, binary version of the Bitcoin Core software, see https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/, or read the original whitepaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "License\n",
    "Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See COPYING for more information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Development Process\n",
    "The master branch is regularly built (see doc/build-*.md for instructions) and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are created regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contribution workflow is described in CONTRIBUTING.md and useful hints for developers can be found in doc/developer-notes.md.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing\n",
    "Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people lots of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated Testing\n",
    "Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run (assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: make check. Further details on running and extending unit tests can be found in /src/test/README.md.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also regression and integration tests, written in Python, that are run automatically on the build server. These tests can be run (if the test dependencies are installed) with: test/functional/test_runner.py\n",
    "\n",
    "The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing\n",
    "Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is not straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translations\n",
    "Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to Bitcoin Core's Transifex page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the translation process for details on how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translators should also subscribe to the mailing list.\"\"\"\n",

    "\n",
    "For more information about installing and using Helm, see the Helm Docs. For a quick introduction to Charts, see the Chart Guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Status of the Project\n",
    "Similar to the Helm 2 Support Plan, this GitHub project has begun transition to a 1 year \"maintenance mode\" (see Deprecation Timeline below). Given the deprecation plan, this project is intended for apiVersion: v1 Charts (installable by both Helm 2 and 3), and not for apiVersion: v2 charts (installable by Helm 3 only).\n",
    "\n",
    "Deprecation Timeline\n",
    "Nov 13, 2019\tAt Helm 3's public release, new charts are no longer accepted to stable or incubator. Patches to existing charts may continue to be submitted by the community, and (time permitting) reviewed by chart OWNERS for acceptance\n",
    "Aug 13, 2020\tAt 9 months – when Helm v2 goes security fix only – the stable and incubator repos will be de-listed from the Helm Hub. Chart OWNERS are encouraged to accept security fixes only. ℹ️ Note: the original date has been extended 3 months to match Helm v2 support. See COVID-19: Extending Helm v2 Bug Fixes\n",
    "Nov 13, 2020\tAt 1 year, support for this project will formally end, and this repo will be marked obsolete\n",
    "This timeline gives the community (chart OWNERS, organizations, groups or individuals who want to host charts) 9 months to move charts to new Helm repos, and list these new repos on the Helm Hub before stable and incubator are de-listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this project has been under active development for some time, so you might run into issues. If you do, please don't be shy about letting us know, or better yet, contribute a fix or feature (within the deprecation timeline of course). Also be aware the repo and chart OWNERS are volunteers so reviews are as time allows, and acceptance is up to the chart OWNERS - you may reach out but please be patient and courteous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where to Find Us\n",
    "For general Helm Chart discussions join the Helm Charts (#charts) room in the Kubernetes Slack instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For issues and support for Helm and Charts see Support Channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Do I Install These Charts?\n",
    "Just helm install stable/<chart>. This is the default repository for Helm which is located at https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/ and is installed by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on using Helm, refer to the Helm documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Do I Enable the Stable Repository for Helm 3?\n",
    "To add the Helm Stable Charts for your local client, run helm repo add:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com\n",
    "\"stable\" has been added to your repositories\n",
    "How Do I Enable the Incubator Repository?\n",
    "To add the Incubator charts for your local client, run helm repo add:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ helm repo add incubator https://kubernetes-charts-incubator.storage.googleapis.com\n",
    "\"incubator\" has been added to your repositories\n",
    "You can then run helm search incubator to see the charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chart Format\n",
    "Take a look at the alpine example chart for reference when you're writing your first few charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before contributing a Chart, become familiar with the format. Note that the project is still under active development and the format may still evolve a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repository Structure\n",
    "This GitHub repository contains the source for the packaged and versioned charts released in the gs://kubernetes-charts Google Storage bucket (the Chart Repository).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Charts in the stable/ directory in the master branch of this repository match the latest packaged Chart in the Chart Repository, though there may be previous versions of a Chart available in that Chart Repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this repository is to provide a place for maintaining and contributing official Charts, with CI processes in place for managing the releasing of Charts into the Chart Repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Charts in this repository are organized into two folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "stable\n",
    "incubator\n",
    "Stable Charts meet the criteria in the technical requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incubator Charts are those that do not meet these criteria. Having the incubator folder allows charts to be shared and improved on until they are ready to be moved into the stable folder. The charts in the incubator/ directory can be found in the gs://kubernetes-charts-incubator Google Storage Bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a Chart from incubator to stable, Chart maintainers should open a pull request that moves the chart folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributing to an Existing Chart\n",
    "We'd love for you to contribute to an existing Chart that you find provides a useful application or service for Kubernetes. Please read our Contribution Guide for more information on how you can contribute Charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We use the same workflow, License and Contributor License Agreement as the main Kubernetes repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Owning and Maintaining A Chart\n",
    "Individual charts can be maintained by one or more users of GitHub. When someone maintains a chart they have the access to merge changes to that chart. To have merge access to a chart someone needs to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Be listed on the chart, in the Chart.yaml file, as a maintainer. If you need sponsors and have contributed to the chart, please reach out to the existing maintainers, or if you are having trouble connecting with them, please reach out to one of the OWNERS of the charts repository.\n",
    "Be invited (and accept your invite) as a read-only collaborator on this repo. This is required for @k8s-ci-robot PR comment interaction.\n",
    "An OWNERS file needs to be added to a chart. That OWNERS file should list the maintainers' GitHub login names for both the reviewers and approvers sections. For an example see the Drupal chart. The OWNERS file should also be appended to the .helmignore file.\n",
    "Once these three steps are done a chart approver can merge pull requests following the directions in the REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trusted Collaborator\n",
    "The pull-charts-e2e test run, that installs a chart to test it, is required before a pull request can be merged. These tests run automatically for members of the Helm Org and for chart repository collaborators. For regular contributors who are trusted, in a manner similar to Kubernetes community members, we have trusted collaborators. These individuals can have their tests run automatically as well as mark other pull requests as ok to test by adding a comment of /ok-to-test on pull requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two paths to becoming a trusted collaborator. One only needs follow one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a Kubernetes GitHub org member and have your Kubernetes org membership public you can become a trusted collaborator for Helm Charts\n",
    "Get sponsorship from one of the Charts Maintainers listed in the OWNERS file at the root of this repository\n",
    "The process to get added is:\n",
    "\n",
    "File an issue asking to be a trusted collaborator\n",
    "A Helm Chart Maintainer can then add the user as a read only collaborator to the repository\n",
    "Review Process\n",
    "For information related to the review procedure used by the Chart repository maintainers, see Merge approval and release process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stale Pull Requests and Issues\n",
    "Pull Requests and Issues that have no activity for 30 days automatically become stale. After 30 days of being stale, without activity, they become rotten. Pull Requests and Issues can rot for 30 days and then they are automatically closed. This is the standard stale process handling for all repositories on the Kubernetes GitHub organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supported Kubernetes Versions\n",
    "This chart repository supports the latest and previous minor versions of Kubernetes. For example, if the latest minor release of Kubernetes is 1.8 then 1.7 and 1.8 are supported. Charts may still work on previous versions of Kubernertes even though they are outside the target supported window.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide that support the API versions of objects should be those that work for both the latest minor release and the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy Helming in China\n",
    "If you are in China, there are some problems to use upstream Helm Charts directly (e.g. images hosted on gcr.io, quay.io, and Charts hosted on googleapis.com etc), you can use this mirror repo at https://github.com/cloudnativeapp/charts which automatically sync & replace unavailable image & repo URLs in every Chart.\"\"\"\n",
